# Friendly Waving Penguin 🐧👋
Welcome to the Friendly Penguin project! In this project, you will see a happy penguin waving hi, created using pure HTML and CSS animations. The design is fun, cute and responsive. 

## How It Works
The penguin is created with basic HTML structure using div elements and styled with CSS. The waving effect is achieved through CSS @keyframes, where the penguin's arm (wing) moves up and down in a smooth, looped animation.
